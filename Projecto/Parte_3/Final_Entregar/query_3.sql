/* Task 3 query

If	the	patient	does	not	exist	in	the	database,	it	is	necessary	to	register	it	first.	Create	a	
set	of	Web	pages	where	both	operations	(the	registration	of	the	new	patient	and	the	
scheduling	of	the	appointment)	are	performed	in	a	single	transaction.	If	the	scheduling	
of	the	appointment	fails,	then	the	registration	of	the	patient	should	be	cancelled.	The	
scheduling	of	the	appointment	will	fail	if	the	specified	date	falls	on	a	weekend.
